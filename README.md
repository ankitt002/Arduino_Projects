## Getting Started

If you're new to Arduino or this repository, start with the following steps to set up your environment and hardware.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ankitt002/arduino-projects.git
    ```

2. Explore the individual project folders to find projects that interest you.

3. Follow the project-specific instructions provided in each folder.

## Projects Overview

### LED Projects

Explore various LED-related projects to learn about basic digital output and controlling LEDs with Arduino.

- **Blinking LED:** Simple project to make an LED blink at different intervals.
- **Traffic light Control:** Control an traffic light.

### Actuator Projects

Discover projects involving actuators to understand how to control physical motion using Arduino.

- **Servo Motor Control:** Control a servo motor's position using Arduino.
- **DC Motor Speed Control:** Learn to control the speed of a DC motor.
- **Stepper Motor Control:** Control a stepper motor rotation/steps.

### Sensor Projects

Dive into sensor-based projects to understand how to read data from the environment.

- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor:** Use a DHT sensor to measure temperature and humidity.
- **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement:** Measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **...and many more sensors:** Integrate different sensor with arduino and see output.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE (download from [Arduino official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- LEDs, actuators, and sensors as per project requirements

## How to Use

Each project folder/file contains a README file with specific instructions on how to set up and run the project. Follow the steps provided in each README to gain knowledge and experience with Arduino.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an Arduino project to share or want to improve existing ones, feel free to submit pull requests.
