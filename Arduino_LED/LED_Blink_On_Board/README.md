# Arduino Uno LED Blinking Project

This project demonstrates how to blink the built-in LED present on the Arduino Uno board using Arduino IDE.

## Getting Started

### Components Needed
- Arduino Uno board
- USB cable for connection
- Computer with Arduino IDE installed

### Circuit Diagram
No external components are needed. Simply connect your Arduino Uno board to your computer via USB cable.

### Installation Instructions
1. Connect your Arduino Uno board to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3. Copy the code from `LED_Bink_On_Board.ino` into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno board.
5. The built-in LED (usually connected to pin 13) should start blinking.

## Code Explanation
The `LED_Bink_On_Board.ino` file contains a simple Arduino sketch that blinks the built-in LED on the Arduino Uno board. The LED blinks on and off with a delay of 1 second between each state change.

## Usage
Once the sketch is uploaded to the Arduino Uno board, the LED will start blinking automatically. You can modify the code to change the blinking pattern, duration, etc., according to your requirements.
