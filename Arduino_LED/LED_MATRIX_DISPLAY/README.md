# LED Matrix Display Project

This Arduino project utilizes a LED matrix display to show various patterns or animations. In this example, a smiley face pattern is displayed on the LED matrix.

## Description

The project employs an Arduino board and a LED matrix display to create visual patterns or animations. The LED matrix display is controlled using the LedControl library. In the provided code, a smiley face pattern is displayed on the LED matrix, but you can create more display patterns or animations by modifying the code accordingly.

## Components Used

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED matrix display
- Resistors (if necessary)
- Jumper wires

## Instructions

1. Connect the LED matrix display to the Arduino board using the data, clock, and chip select (CS) pins. Adjust the pin numbers in the code according to your wiring configuration.
2. Upload the provided code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible software.
3. Once uploaded, the LED matrix display will show the smiley face pattern. It will remain on the display for 2 seconds before updating with another pattern or animation.
4. Experiment with the code by creating more display patterns or animations to showcase on the LED matrix.

## Code Explanation

- The LedControl library is used to control the LED matrix display.
- In the `setup()` function, the display is initialized by turning it on, setting the brightness, and clearing the display.
- The `loop()` function continuously calls the `displaySmiley()` function to display the smiley face pattern on the LED matrix.
- The `displaySmiley()` function defines the smiley face pattern as a byte array and sets each row of the LED matrix display accordingly.
